<p>One of the most talked about topics in 2016 when it comes to Bitcoin is the
lack of good plan for growing and scaling of the system into the future.</p>

<p>I found this curious as anyone that starts to depend on any system should
do at least some investigation on what kind of growth it can handle, and
if it can actually do what we want it to do, this year and 5 years or
longer into the future.</p>

<p>In this post I want to investigate what kind of scaling we can expect
Bitcoin to have and what we need to do to get more scaling out of the
system if it would not be enough.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>The number one reason that Bitcoin has value right now is its <em>promise</em>
that Bitcoin will be used and seen as useful by millions of people in the
not-so-far future.  Any money only has value when enough people think it
has value.  Any money only has value when it actually can be <em>used</em>. If
nobody accepts it for payments, the value will not be realized either.</p>

<p>So the number one goal is to allow millions of people to be able to use
Bitcoin in their day-to-day lives. Where 'use' is defined as making at
least one transaction a day. As any technology, we don't expect this load
to be available tomorrow, or this year because growth happens over time and
systems get build over time.</p>

<p>So lets have a goal of 50 million users sending one transaction a day using
the Bitcoin network. Not today but 5 year in the future.</p>

<p>Further goal is that for home-users the rate at which they can process
Bitcoin blocks should be at least twice the speed at which they get
created.  This means that if a system has no internet for an hour it would
take no more than half an hour at full speed to catch up.  Faster is
better, but slower than twice the creation speed is too slow.</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>

<p><strong>or, what is the current theoretical level of support</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin, in the form of various node-software implementations, has had
several years to mature. The leadership was not really focused on growth
very much of this basic layer as we can see from the amount of progress
that started happening <em>after</em> Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited
started competing. As usual, competition is good for the end-user and we
see some promise of future gains appear.</p>

<p>But lets take a look at what kind of transaction load we could support
today.</p>

<p>Last week <a href="http://forum.bitcoin.com">forum.bitcoin.com</a> published a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=45&amp;v=vL8ZRYsLdoY">video</a> about
time it takes to download, fully validate and check 7 years, or 420000
blocks of Bitcoin history. From day on of Bitcoin. This is 75GB of data
which took 6 hours and 50 minutes to fully validate on moderate hardware.
It wasn't cheap hardware, but it was certainly not top-of-the-line or
server hardware.  In other words, it is a good baseline.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at what was done in 6hours 50min</p>

<ul>
<li>since block
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoinclassic/bitcoinclassic/blob/1.1/src/chainparams.cpp#L154">295000</a>
till block 420000 (125000 blocks) each and every transaction signature has
been validated.</li>
<li>75GB was downloaded from Bitcoin peers around the world.</li>
<li>It build a UTXO database of 11 million transactions with 40 million
not yet spent Bitcoin addresses.  (see the RPC call gettxoutsetinfo).</li>
<li>The 125000 blocks contained 104847758 <a href="findTxCount.pl">transactions</a> which
have all been validated.  Thats 105 Million txs.</li>
</ul>

<p>We understand that this was all done with no tweaks to the settings. This
was a Classic 1.1.0 node (equivalent to Bitcoin Core 0.12.1)</p>

<h2 id="whatneedswork">What needs work?</h2>

<p>Lets take a look and compare our baseline to our goal. Most people would
like software to always get faster and better, but priorities matter and we
should look at which parts need attention first.</p>

<p>Our goal was that individual node needs to process in 24 hours about 50
million transactions.</p>

<p>We noticed that in the baseline check of 6h50 hours it actually
downloaded and stored and checked almost 105 million transactions.
Which leads to a daily rate of 368 million transactions being downloaded and
validated.</p>

<p>$$ TX_{day} = {{104847758 tx \over { 6 * 60 + 50 minutes}} * 24 * 60 minutes} = 368 million$$</p>

<p>This means that our 5-years-in-the-future goal of 50 million transactions
per day is already today not an issue for bandwidth and for CPU power. In
fact, out baseline system managed to go over it with over a factor of 7.</p>

<p>Today our baseline system could handle 7 times the volume that is the goal
5 years in the future!</p>

<p>Today, an individual Bitcoin node can download, store and validate 368 million
transactions a day. Thats many times the volume that has <em>ever</em> been sent
using Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="howdoiseethesystemscale">How do I see the system scale?</h2>

<h3 id="atypicalhome-node">A typical home-node</h3>

<p>A node that validates all blocks fully is needed in order to keep
everyone honest. It also gives me peace of mind in that if I trust my node,
I don't have to trust anyone else.  So I foresee that you will get small
communities to gather around full nodes.  You can let your family use it,
or maybe your football club or church will set one up just to support the
community.  Individuals will then make their phone-wallets have at least
one host they trust, which is the one from your community.</p>

<p>This preserves Bitcoins greatest assets, you don't have to trust banks or
governments. People trusting their local church or football club is much
more normal and common to do.</p>

<p>Such a node would have no need to keep the full history till block zero. It
would turn on pruning.  With todays price of hardware this does not mean it
would stop being able to serve historic blocks because it could easily hold
a month of blocks history. This does, however, mean we need to make the
software a bit smarter. See some <a href="../../scaling/Pruning/">pruning</a> ideas.</p>

<p>Harddrive space is cheap today. A 3TB harddrive stores 75 years of Bitcoin
history at current block size.  But what if we start getting to our goal.
What kind of harddrive do we need?</p>

<p>The answer to that is that we don't need anything large at all. The idea
that we need to have a larger harddrive because blocks are bigger is a
misunderstanding. We should work on some <a href="../../scaling/Pruning/">pruning</a> ideas
in order to scale the system without everyone having to invest in storage
space.</p>

<p>The last of the big components for our hone node is internet connectivity.
To reach our goal we need to be able to download 50 million transactions at
about 300 bytes each in a 24 hours period.</p>

<p>$$ {50 000 000 * 300 \over {24 * 60 * 60}} = 173611 bytes/sec $$
  $$ {173611 \over 8} = 22 Kbit/sec $$</p>

<p>Ideally we go twice as fast to make sure that the node can 'catch up' if it
were offline for some time. We may want to add some overhead for other
parts as well. But 22Kb is below the minimum internet speed that can be
acquired practically everywhere as the basic plan. 2Mb (100 times faster)
is practically available in all parts of the world. 2Gb which is 100,000
times faster than what we need to reach our plan in 5 years is available
in countries like Japan today.</p>

<p>Home nodes have absolutely nothing to fear from even a huge growth of
Bitcoin to about 50 million daily users, their hardware and internet will
cover them with no pains, especially in about 5 years when more software
optimizations may have been created.</p>

<p>Notice that there is no dependency on things like Moore's law here, no
hardware growth is needed to reach our goal.</p>

<h2 id="atypicaluser">A typical user</h2>

<p>A typical user is suggested to use a phone or hardware wallet.  The
actual requirements are really not a lot to be able to make payments safely
and fast if you use
<a href="http://bitcoinfactswiki.github.io/Scalability/#Simplified_payment_verification">SPV</a>
clients.</p>

<p>Current wallets are in need of some work, though. They are typically quite
greedy in using network to update the state of the wallet. While useful,
this is not wanted in many situations. When I'm abroad on an expensive
data-plan, for instance.</p>

<p>There is no need to do any communication with the network before creating a
transaction that pays a merchant. Only the actual payment itself needs to
be transferred to the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>A typical user uses a phone. On the topic of scaling there is little to
nothing he has to do in order to continue working with on-chain scaling.</p>

<p>Usability and related topics need substantial amounts of work, though.</p>

<h2 id="atypicalminingnode">A typical mining node</h2>

<p>Miners need a full node. Where 'full' means that it validates all
transactions.  In addition to what a home-node needs, a miner also needs
a fast connection between miners and to have a fast way to broadcast his
blocks to other miners.</p>

<p>Just like with a typical home-node the amount of bandwidth and harddrive
and CPU speed are already today mostly sufficient for being part of the
network.</p>

<p>Additionally, the miner uses his node to create block templates. Which
means he takes a section of the pool of unconfirmed transactions and
creates a block based on that. This process has seen some optimizations
already, but more could be made.  For instance the getblocktemplate RPC
call checks the block it just created for validity before it returns it.
This check takes quite a lot of time and a simple solution would be to
decouple the returning of the block and the validation so the miner can
start mining optimistically over the check passing (it should pass in 100%
of the cases anyway).</p>

<p>The bigger the blocks get, the more data is returned and the system
currently uses JSON which is almost the worst type of data-container for
large binary data-blobs.  A simple replacement of the RPC interface with
something that just changes the communication format to be binary is
relatively easy to do (a month project, probably) and likely needed for
miners to not end up waiting to long on this.</p>

<p>In our baseline node we explained that it took 7 hours to fully sync a
brand new node from zero.  This will stop being the case when we scale up
to much bigger sizes.  It will start taking a substantial amount of time to
do the initial sync.  Yet, a miner requires a fully synced node.
Bitcoin Classic already has one big change there that will push down the
validation time substantially. It introduced dynamic checkpoints which
allow the node to skip validation of transaction data by assuming that
about a week worth of blocks will not be build on top of double-spend data.
This would remove the validation of 100s of millions of transactions for a
starting node.</p>

<p>Another suggestion for future Bitcoin clients meant for miners is that a
new node can be pointed to a known and trusted node.  The new node would
then receive the UTXO and all other details it needs to be up and running
quickly from this trusted node.  Which means that after downloading only a
couple of gigabytes you can have your new node up in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The most important improvements for mining are various ways to ensure fast
download and upload of the actual new blocks.</p>

<p>First there is xthin, which is a way to make a 1MB block only cost 25KB to
send to all miners.  This scaling is linear in that a 10MB block will
likely be around 250KB to send.</p>

<p>Next to that is a technique I called "optimistic mining" which helps miners
by splitting the uploading of blocks into two parts. One is a super fast
notification of the new block. Just the block-header. A miner receiving
such a header validates it has valid proof of work and then can start
mining empty blocks on top.  When the full block has arrived and all
transactions are seen. All transactions in the mempool are updated to
account for the new block, and last, a new block template is created with
as many transactions as fit, only then does the miner start mining it.</p>

<p>A mining node has no need for either a <a href="../On%20Mining%20and%20Wallets">wallet in their
node</a> or to have a history of blocks on their
node, so they can turn on <a href="../../scaling/Pruning/">pruning</a>.</p>

<p>Many of these techniques are already in development or planned to be
developed in the next year or so.  In order to reach our 50 million users
per day in 5 years most of these will be more than enough to make a miner
able to keep connected to the Bitcoin network without having to invest in a
high-end server for the Bitcoin node.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The goal I tried to argue from is 50 million users per day. This goal is
a huge increase from today. But to make sure we do it properly, my goal is
set 5 years in the future.</p>

<p>Scaling Bitcoin-nodes is ultimately boring work with very little effort
needed because it turns out that a modern simple system can already scale
easy 10000 times higher than the current maximum allowed size.</p>

<p>Scaling the entire system takes a little more work, but mostly because
miners have not received a lot of new features that they would need in
order to make scaling safe for them.  Most of those features could be added
in a matter of months, with technologies like xthin blocks and optimistic
mining already well underway.</p>

<p>The conclusion that I have to draw is that the goal of 50M/day is not just
reachable, the timeline of 5 years is likely one that we will beat quite
easily.</p>

<p>Smart tricks like Lightning network are not mentioned at all in this
document because there is no need for them. Bitcoin can scale on-chain
quite easily with almost no risk. Ideas like Lightning are quite high risk
because there are so many unknowns.</p>

<p>By far the biggest problem with regards to scaling today is the protocol
limit of 1MB block size.  This should be removed as soon as possible.</p>
